WordSearcher

A program that is can solve wordsearch puzzles (still under development).

Currently it is being designed to read in the wordsearch matrix and keywords through txt file. After processing, an output txtfile will contain the location of the keywords in the matrix. A simple GUI will also be created so the user doesnt have to use terminal commands.

Languages to be used:
      C for backend processing
      Java for GUI

Installing/Compiling:
  1. run build.sh
  2. execute command:   ./build/wordsearch

Contents:
  Directory /src/ contains the primary C file
  Directory /include/ contains all the custom libraries required by the c files in the src folder


Future Potentials:
Expand the code to work on Android Platform, using image processing
